      <description>This is the second in a series of posts on using a Packer pipeline to generate Vagrant .box files.
In order to begin using Packer to create images, we will first need to lay the &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; ground work. Packer can create virtual machine images on a wide variety of virtualization or cloud platforms, but since I work for VMware I have been using the ESXi hypervisor.
 This post will be covering installing ESXi as a virtual machine on a vSphere cluster.</description>

      <description>In the last few blogs post we have created ESXi .box templates, but in order to create a complete virtual lab using vagrant we will also need a vCenter Server Appliance virtual machine. The vCSA comes as a .ova template, so we will need to convert it to a vagrant-vmware-ovf .box template before we can use it with vagrant.
In this post we will need several packages installed, that we have covered in the last few posts:</description>

      <description>In the previous post I demonstrated using packer to create a ESXi .box template on OS X with fusion and the vagrant vmware provider. Both of these pieces of software have a cost associated with their usage, so in this post I will demonstrate how to use CentOS 6.5 and ESXi for the same results.
In this post we will again talk about two helpful gosddc projects:
 gosddc/packer-post-processor-vagrant-vmware-ovf. This repo contains a packer post processor that leverages VMware OVF Tool to create a vmware_ovf Vagrant box that is compatible with vagrant-vcloud, vagrant-vcenter and vagrant-vcloudair vagrant providers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently working on using packer to create vagrant .box files rather than manually creating them as I documented in a previous post. For this post I will be using fusion and the vagrant vmware provider, each of which have an associated cost, but I will cover a free alternative using packer and CentOS in a future post.
Several github projects by gosddc have helped me in getting packer up and running on my Macbook:</description>

      <title>Using advanced vagrant-vsphere provider settings and vCenter guest customization</title>

      <description>This post will pick up where we left off by demonstrating more vagrant-vsphere provider settings using the CentOS template we customized in the last blog post. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started:
1. Create a new customization specification in the vSphere web client. This customization specification will allow us to set the hostname of the vm created by &amp;ldquo;vagrant up&amp;rdquo; to the same name as the virtual machine.  Go to Home | Customization Specification Manager:   Click the &amp;ldquo;Create a new specification&amp;rdquo; button:   Select &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; for the &amp;ldquo;Target VM Operating System&amp;rdquo; and name the customization specification.</description>

      <description>Some readers might find this post to be a little &amp;ldquo;in the weeds&amp;rdquo; and cover details they are already familiar with. I struggled in my first attempts to get Vagrant working on CentOS, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any good tutorials that covered the entire process. If you get bored with basic network configuration or have another preferred method for installing Ruby, please understand I&amp;rsquo;m trying to provide as much detail as possible to those without much linux experience.</description>
